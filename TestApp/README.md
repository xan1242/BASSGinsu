# BASS Ginsu Test App

This is a simple test app that was used during development of this library

You can use this as a very basic example of usage.

## Binary

There is also a pre-compiled 64-bit binary available in the `testapp_bin` folder with example audio data.

- `runsynth_nowhine.bat` runs without the transmission whine

- `runsynth_forwardwhine.bat` runs with the idle and forward transmission whine

- `runsynth_reversewhine.bat` runs with the reverse whine 

The top speed is capped at 300km/h.

You can control the throttle with left CTRL or the right trigger on a XInput controller.
